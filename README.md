# Java-with-RDF-Parliament-Server
A project for me to learn how to query a Parliament RDF triple store using SPARQL in Java. 

Data being used is stored in the [data folder](https://github.com/JTODR/Java-with-RDF-Parliament-Server/tree/master/data) 

Parliament can be downloaded [here](http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/)
